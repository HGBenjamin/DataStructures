# DataStructures

A comprehensive repository dedicated to learning, implementing, and understanding data structures and algorithms.

## 📘 About This Repository

This project is a personal learning space where I explore a wide range of data structures and algorithms — from the fundamentals to more advanced concepts.
My goal is twofold:

1. **To deepen my own understanding** through hands-on implementation and experimentation.
2. **To share that knowledge with others** who may find these examples helpful in their own learning journey.

Whether you're a beginner trying to grasp the basics or someone brushing up on key concepts, this repository aims to serve as a clear, practical resource.

## 🎯 Purpose & Philosophy

Learning data structures is most effective when you build them yourself.
This repo is built around that idea:

* **Learn by doing** — every structure and algorithm is implemented from scratch.
* **Keep it accessible** — code aims to be easy to follow, not overly clever.
* **Share knowledge** — others can freely study, use, or adapt the examples.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the code, clone the repo, or build on top of it.
If you're learning, try the following:

* Read through an implementation
* Re-create it yourself from scratch
* Compare approaches
* Experiment with variations and improvements
